/*
It is not mandatory to have this document but it can speed up the process and make life easier for other developer. We can have proper documentation of the guidelines or practices we are following during the development process but it would be quick to have a brief documentation of major ideas which should be considered while developing an application. For eg. 

### Naming conventions used in the application
- Controller names: camel case eg. LoginController
- Folder and file names: lower case separated with underscore eg. login_controller.js, auth_service.js
- Service names should be came case eg. AuthService

### Widely resuable code snippet 
- We have used base64 conversion directive to send image files to server
  Ref: https://github.com/adonespitogo/angular-base64-upload
    <form name="form">
      <input type="file" ng-model="files" name="files" multiple accept="image/*, .zip" maxsize="5000" required base-sixty-four-input>
      <span ng-show="form.files.$error.maxsize">Files must not exceed 5000 KB</span>
    </form>
*/
